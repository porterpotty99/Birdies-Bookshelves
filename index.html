                    <p>Birdie has been reading for as long as she can remember. Her favorite part of school was always the library, a magical place filled with endless stories. An avid reader who devours 200-300 books a year, romance has always been one of her favorite genresâ€”with dark romance being a particular guilty pleasure. As a passionate LGBTQ+ advocate, Birdie is committed to creating an inclusive space. Her dream for Birdie's Bookshelves is to share the profound joy of books and build a vibrant, welcoming community for all romance lovers.</p>
